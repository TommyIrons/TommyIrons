- 👋 Hi, I’m @TommyIrons. I'm a final-year PhD student at the University of Exeter.
- 👀 I’m interested in applying statistical science to interesting environmental and health challenges, which means I love working with data!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various approximate Bayesian inference methods for statistical post-processing of weather forecasts for my PhD. Primarily, I am focused on extreme river flow rates and their predictability with simple models.
